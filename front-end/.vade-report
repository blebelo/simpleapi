# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 to dependencies
- Used npm to install the package and update lock files

### 2. Modified Files

**package.json**
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to the dependencies section

**package-lock.json**
- Updated to reflect the new dependency and its transitive dependencies

**src/app/layout.tsx**
- Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
- Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and styling

## Implementation Details

This is an App Router project (Next.js 16.1.6), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`. The component was placed after the children content inside the body tag, following Vercel's recommended best practices.

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
✅ Linter passed with no errors (`npm run lint`)
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ All lock files properly updated

The Analytics component will now automatically track page views and web vitals when the application is deployed to Vercel.
